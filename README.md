# CSHARP-Coding-Practice-
Studying @Daniaerhversakadami Silkeborg as a datamatiker (Programmer) 
Im Practicing C# by doing excercies from lectures at my school and online courses, in my own program
this makes learning a language for me much more effective by not being stuck in tutorial hell/ai helper cycle 

List of practices includes:
1. Menu Selection screen 
2. Number of Kayak's 
3. Math excercies 
4. Test
